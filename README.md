Rocketseat - Ignite - Chapter #1 - Challenge 1

This repo is dedicated to show my work doing a todo list for Rocketseat's Ignite React course. 

It was used some concepts like:

- Immutability;
- React Hooks (useState);
- JSX;
- JavaScript events;
- JavaScript methods (map, filter);

... and so on :)
